        Pumi was rescued by a celebrity supporter of PAWS who spotted the poor dog inside a barangay pound cage while she was shooting a television show. 
        Pumi is shy and gentle but she is easily startled by loud noises. We are looking for someone who understands that overcoming traumatic life experiences is tough and may take time,
        someone who can assure Pumi that she will always be safe and that she will never be abandoned
